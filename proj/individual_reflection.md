# Individual reflection

I think I work well in a team. I know that I in some manners are not a perfect team member but I think that overall I am good for a group. I tend to want to take on a leading role in the group and I hope that I do a good job at it. I do have a pattern that I should try to change and that is to work quite little at the start of a project and then work a lot near the end. This usually leads to pressure being put upon myself and the rest of the group.

This is very much depending on who I am in a group with. If I am with people who I know I can communicate with, who does their part and who can work well with me I gain quite a lot from working in a group. On the other hand if I am with people who does neither of these things it just makes me hate the entire project and feels like it is more of a chore than it has to be. It just demotivates me when I am with people who I don't like to work with.

When it comes to programming I have learnt a similar amount but when it comes to how to lead and work in a project I've learn a huge amount! There are so many things I would do differently if given the chance now that we have experienced first hand how not to handle some things. 

I think it has gone well to log the time. We had a spreadsheet where it was very easy to put in how much you've worked and on what.

My biggest fail was easily my planning of the work. I should have started with the bulk of the project much earlier than I did. My biggest win was probably not the smartest thing but it just made me so happy when I did it. I was sitting bug-hunting with the unit tests and couldn't for my life understand why a test didn't work so I removed a small piece of code which seemed dumb and everything got fixed.

When I work in group project I tend to not be the one that is leading the group. However I do like to be involved in decisions regarding the project. I like working in a group because I like to bounce ideas off somebody in order to develop.  But the group can't be too big so that the divided work doesn't get too small. My strengths when working in a group is usualy that I always get the work that is handed to me done. However, during this project , I have had some non school related work that has stoped me from deliver as planed. I hve tried to be clear with the group when things didnät go as planed for me.    

During this project have I learnt a lot about working on a project together with a smaller group. This has been very educational. One thing that was good with this project is that I was forced to track the time spent on the work that was done. This is something that I haven't appreciate before but now see the value in.    

The biggest problem that I faced with this project is that I didn't find the time that I wanted to but in the effort I wanted. I the end this doesn't only make me suffer but also the group. Luckily this didn't have that big of an impact on the group this time but it is something that I will try to fix for my next group work.
