#Individual reflection
 I think I work well in a team. I know that I in some manners are not a perfect team member but I think that overall I am good for a group. I tend to want to take on a leading role in the group and I hope that I do a good job at it. I do have a pattern that I should try to change and that is to work quite little at the start of a project and then work a lot near the end. This usually leads to pressure being put upon myself and the rest of the group.

This is very much depending on who I am in a group with. If I am with people who I know I can communicate with, who does their part and who can work well with me I gain quite a lot from working in a group. On the other hand if I am with people who does neither of these things it just makes me hate the entire project and feels like it is more of a chore than it has to be. It just demotivates me when I am with people who I don't like to work with.

When it comes to programming I have learnt a similar amount but when it comes to how to lead and work in a project I've learn a huge amount! There are so many things I would do differently if given the chance now that we have experienced first hand how not to handle some things. 

I think it has gone well to log the time. We had a spreadsheet where it was very easy to put in how much you've worked and on what.

My biggest fail was easily my planning of the work. I should have started with the bulk of the project much earlier than I did. My biggest win was probably not the smartest thing but it just made me so happy when I did it. I was sitting bug-hunting with the unit tests and couldn't for my life understand why a test didn't work so I removed a small piece of code which seemed dumb and everything got fixed.
