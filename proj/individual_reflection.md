# Individual reflection

Albin Barchéus

I think I work well in a team. I know that I in some manners are not a perfect team member but I think that overall I am good for a group. I tend to want to take on a leading role in the group and I hope that I do a good job at it. I do have a pattern that I should try to change and that is to work quite little at the start of a project and then work a lot near the end. This usually leads to pressure being put upon myself and the rest of the group.

This is very much depending on who I am in a group with. If I am with people who I know I can communicate with, who does their part and who can work well with me I gain quite a lot from working in a group. On the other hand if I am with people who does neither of these things it just makes me hate the entire project and feels like it is more of a chore than it has to be. It just demotivates me when I am with people who I don't like to work with.

When it comes to programming I have learnt a similar amount but when it comes to how to lead and work in a project I've learn a huge amount! There are so many things I would do differently if given the chance now that we have experienced first hand how not to handle some things. 

I think it has gone well to log the time. We had a spreadsheet where it was very easy to put in how much you've worked and on what.

My biggest fail was easily my planning of the work. I should have started with the bulk of the project much earlier than I did. My biggest win was probably not the smartest thing but it just made me so happy when I did it. I was sitting bug-hunting with the unit tests and couldn't for my life understand why a test didn't work so I removed a small piece of code which seemed dumb and everything got fixed.

When I work in group project I tend to not be the one that is leading the group. However I do like to be involved in decisions regarding the project. I like working in a group because I like to bounce ideas off somebody in order to develop.  But the group can't be too big so that the divided work doesn't get too small. My strengths when working in a group is usualy that I always get the work that is handed to me done. However, during this project , I have had some non school related work that has stoped me from deliver as planed. I hve tried to be clear with the group when things didnät go as planed for me.    

During this project have I learnt a lot about working on a project together with a smaller group. This has been very educational. One thing that was good with this project is that I was forced to track the time spent on the work that was done. This is something that I haven't appreciate before but now see the value in.    

The biggest problem that I faced with this project is that I didn't find the time that I wanted to but in the effort I wanted. I the end this doesn't only make me suffer but also the group. Luckily this didn't have that big of an impact on the group this time but it is something that I will try to fix for my next group work.

I'd like to see myself as a dynamic team player, one that is able to listen and adapt, I take great pride in what I deliver and is usually productive and reliable. This can also be to a disadvantage to the team as I somtimes don't trust tasks to be done by other team members and refrain from including them in a problem. I should delegate more to fellow team members and keep them more in the loop.

I enjoy problem solving. If I can see a somewhat constant progress towards an end goal, I usually stay motivated. Personal accomplishments keeps me going, typically one small milestone a day is enough to keep me feeling motivated and upbeat. A demotivator for me is when i feel that another team member is not pulling its weight. I can tolerate one or so non-contributors but if the team spirit isn't there then neither is my heart in the project.

As far as programming tasks go I would say that I'm fairly good at estimating the time needed. My usual thinking is that most smaller implementations or changes can usually be finished within 2-3 hours, at least to a point where only tuning and bug fixing remains. When making any major changes to existing code I usually set aside at least 5 hours for reading up on a technique, refactoring and figuring out how and in what steps to implement the change.

Time logginf has worked very well, providing a clear picture of the workload.

I believe that I'm best suited for a 'producing' role, i.e. programmer. I tend to try and avoid conflicts at great lengths and is not suited for a leadership role.

My biggest "win" was using static lists for garbage pointers and destructor functions, thus reducing the meta data size from 40 bytes to 6. The biggest problem I encountered was getting over 1000 allocated bytes for one single integer. For three hours I scanned the code looking for these bytes. It turned out to come from a single call to printf.

I feel that I have learned a lot of Git during the project, much more than during the rest of the course since more people were invlolved and higher discipline was needed. I haven't really used static variables before so that is also something I'm taking with me.

Under projektet har Gulhämplingarna haft ett mycket splittrat engagemang till detta projekt! Jag upplever att jag har tagit ansvar för utveckling och optimering, samt strukturering av design dokumentet. Jag har uppskattat att få testa på att ha ett större projekt men som alltid har man haft lite olika engagemang vilket har påverkat processen i gruppen. Jag känner att vi som individer har haft lite olika driv när det kommer till projektet, dock har det funnits godkända skäl för en mindre mängd tid lagd på projektet gentemot sina partners. Exempel som omtentor eller utlandsresor har försvårat vissa tillfällen men många har gjort sitt bästa för att lägga den efterfrågade tiden.

Vi började projektet mycket väl genom att lägga upp en bra planering tillsammans med en gemensam tidsrapportering i excel. Detta var något som jag verkligen gillade att vi gjorde, har varit bra att kunna se hur folk jobbat och när dem jobbat. Under projektets gång har vi valt att använda oss av KANBAN vilket jag samt många andra i gruppen tyckte lät som en mycket bra plan, men har insett under projektets gång att det hade passat oss alla mycket bättre om vi valt att köra på SCRUM i stället.

De största problemen som vi stött på i vår grupp är att vi ej setts tillräckligt i person under projektets gång! Detta har varit en bieffekt av att folk rest hem under julledigheten, vilket har gjort att vi fått förlita oss på Slack kommunikation & möten över internet. Något som inte fungerat alls så bra som jag hoppats, folk har valt att inte dyka upp och en i gruppen har valt att helt ignorera alla våra försök till kommunikation under julledigheten. Trots att denna individ ignorerat all försök till kommunikation under julledigheten har vi givit honom möjligheten att fortfarande utföra sina arbetsuppgifter, det var inte förens han valde att ignorera oss även efter julledigheten & missa ett obligatoriskt möte som vi alla bestämde oss för att ha. Då gjorde vi som ett team det gemensamma beslutet att rösta om personen i säga skulle få vara kvar i projektet eller om vi väljer att fortsätta utan honom.

Det positiva som jag upplevt under projektets gång är garanterat att vi valt att köra parprogrammering mot hela projektet! Då jag har kommit bra överens med min programmerings partner och vi båda har engagerat oss för att verkligen skriva bra och väldokumenterad kod. Par programmeringen har inte bara varit positiv det har gjort att vi som grupp fått lov att skriva deviations mot issue logs i github. Detta för att vi tagit allt med vår respektive programmerings partner.
