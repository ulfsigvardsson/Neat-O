# Individual Reflection

### How do I function in a team
I tend to be quite passive in a team, especially if I feel like I am not the one with most experience.
But overall I think I work pretty good in a team, because of my passive attitude, I listen to all other members of the team, but it can also be a weakness and cause me to be so passive that I don't really contribute so much th the team.

### What motivates me? What demotivates me?
The biggest motivator for me in any type of project is a feeling of progress, and on the flip side of that, my biggest demotivator is when the project have stalled or you don't really know what to work on next.

### How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?
I am really bad at estimating work time for my tasks, mostly it comedowns to inexperience, since I haven't done a certain task before, I don't know how long it will take.

### Do you gain any thing by working in a group, or do you prefer to work alone?
I think I prefer working in pairs or solo before working in bigger groups, but I think itâ€™s because I have had bad experiences working in group in school projects before, where it almost never worked out well to work in a group.

### How do you best retain knowledge
I think I learn best from first listening/seeing and the doing, but in group project like this is feels more like learn by failing, which can be really demotivating sometimes.
