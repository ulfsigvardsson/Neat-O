## Ulf Sigvardsson

I'd like to see myself as a dynamic team player, one that is able to listen and adapt,
I take great pride in what I deliver and is usually productive and reliable. This can also be to a disadvantage to the team as I somtimes don't trust
tasks to be done by other team members and refrain from including them in a problem. I should delegate more to fellow team members and keep them more in the loop.

I enjoy problem solving. If I can see a somewhat constant progress towards an end goal, I usually stay motivated. Personal accomplishments keeps me going,
typically one small milestone a day is enough to keep me feeling motivated and upbeat.
A demotivator for me is when i feel that another team member is not pulling its weight. I can tolerate one or so non-contributors but if the team spirit isn't
there then neither is my heart in the project.

As far as programming tasks go I would say that I'm fairly good at estimating the time needed. My usual thinking is that
most smaller implementations or changes can usually be finished within 2-3 hours, at least to a point where only tuning and bug fixing remains. When making any major changes to existing code
I usually set aside at least 5 hours for reading up on a technique, refactoring and figuring out how and in what steps to implement the change.

Time logginf has worked very well, providing a clear picture of the workload.

I believe that I'm best suited for a 'producing' role, i.e. programmer. I tend to try and avoid conflicts at great lengths and is not suited for a leadership role.

My biggest "win" was using static lists for garbage pointers and destructor functions, thus reducing the meta data size from 40 bytes to 6.
The biggest problem I encountered was getting over 1000 allocated bytes for one single integer. For three hours I scanned the code looking for these bytes. It turned out to come from a single
call to printf.

I feel that I have learned a lot of Git during the project, much more than during the rest of the course since more people were invlolved and higher discipline was needed. I haven't really used static variables before so that is also something I'm taking with me.
